# xG1000 PCB

## The Design

I have played with Arduinos for years and done the basics of learning how to wire a simple button, rotary encoder, potentiometer, LED etc.  So, to make a G1000, or xG1000 as I am calling it to avoid any over-zealous lawyer, it was quite simple.  The real life G1000 is made up of a mixture of these.  I built and created by schema using EasyEDA which is a fantastic PCB prototyping application (https://www.easyeda.com) and simply connected each component to a pin on an Arduino Mega2560.  I used Mega2560 as they have the most pins to use, are cheap (approx £7 each) and most Flight Sim software use these.  I tend to have several laying around.

The idea design meant that it would attach 2 x Mega2560s to a solid, single PCB where all of the components were attached.  Basically, creating a complex Arduino Shield.  I have seen many homemade G1000s over the years with 100s of wires; whilst they are fantastic and work perfectly, the amount of effort, problems with alignment, near-impossible troubleshooting, simply was not worth it.  I tried.  Failed.  Wasted a lot of time.  

This time, I wanted to do it efficiently.

## The Fabrication

Once I had gone through each pin - and there are nearly 400 on this board - I had them fabricated in China.

A note on errors and wastage.  I went through 4 fabrication cycles to get this final one to work.  At cost.  And about 3 weeks delivery per cycle.  It happens.  I have spent £1000s over the last 2 years with prototypes due to wiring mistakes - never a manufacturing error.
