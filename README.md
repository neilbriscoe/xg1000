**Garmin G1000 panel for XP11 and MSFS2020**

This is a **GUIDE** to making a G1000 unofficial replica to be used with Air Manager (or MobiFlight) that uses Arduinos, a generic LCD display, several buttons, encoders... that can be made at home.

In total, this was made for approx Â£180, but a lot in time, patience and trial/error.

**SKILLS REQUIRED**

You will need to be familiar with Arduinos, 3D printing, Laser cutting/engraving and understand basics of electronics.  
Oh, and decent with a soldering irons and a good eye!  

You will also need an AirManager license or know how to use MobiFlight.
